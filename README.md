# SQL-Project
In this project we developed a match making app for an educational program that would facilitate meaningful connections among its alumni community. Users could create detailed profiles and select specific connection styles ranging from professional partnerships to friendship or mentorship. The app's advanced filtering allows users to find potential business partners, friends or potential colleagues based on wide range of criteria. Our goal was to create a robust platform that would foster genuine relationships and collaborations within the alumni community. Our objective revolved around ensuring precision in user data for matching, conducting searches, monitoring match statuses, and producing extensive reports on diverse user attributes and preferences, thereby enriching the alumni network experience.
